Vehicle Location Service
========================

A vehicle location service. Vehicles can update the server on their location, and a user
can query the server for a list of vehicles in a specified area. The assumption is while a vehicle is in motion it
updates it's location every few seconds.

## Setup

1. If not already present, install Python 3.11 and [virtualeenvwrapper](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper/)
2. Create a local virtualenv
```
$ mkvirtualenv {your-env-name}
```
3. Install project dependencies using
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

We use [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/tutorial.html#running-nox-for-the-first-time) as our testing framework. To run the tests do the following:
1. Install `nox`
```bash
$ pip install nox
```
2. Run `nox` tests
```bash
$ nox --session unit_test -f noxfile.py
```
